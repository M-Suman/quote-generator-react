# Introduction 
This is my first React-js project.

Feature that I have implemented in this project:
1. In this code, the state variable advise is initialized with an empty string using useState(""). The setAdvise function is used to update the state with the fetched advice string.
2. . In this code, useEffect is used to fetch the advice from the API when the component is first mounted, which is indicated by the empty dependency array [] as the second argument.
3. When the user clicks the "GIVE ME ADVICE!" button, the fetchAdvice function is called again to fetch a new piece of advice and update the component state using setAdvise.

I have created an interesting react project from scratch - A React Advice App where I have used React on the front end and we'll make get requests to Advice Slip JSON API.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start```
